Assignment 2, in CSE 415, Winter 2018.

This file contains my problem formulation for the problem of
the Farmer, Fox, Chicken, and Grain.

Problem Description:
There is a Farmer, Fox, Chicken, and Grain on the left bank of a river.
The farmer has a boat to can carry the farmer and item across the river.
The farmer wants to carry all of his items to the right bank of the river.
However, the Fox can't be left with the Chicken and the Chicken can't be left
with the Grain.
Figure out how to carry everything to the right bank of the river.
