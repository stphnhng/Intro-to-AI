Write a Python function definition that returns the heuristic value associated
with the 15 puzzle, based on the Manhattan distance. Assume here that the blank
square is represented by 0, and that its distance from its position in the 
current state to its position in the goal should be included in the sum.


sample_start = [[ 2,  7, 12,  1],\
                [ 0,  5, 10, 15],\
                [ 4,  9, 14,  1],\
                [ 6, 11,  3,  8]]

GOAL = [[ 0,  1,  2,  3],\
        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],\
        [ 8,  9, 10, 11],\
        [12, 13, 14, 15]]

Consider the following sequence of "facts" that are being entered into an ISA hierarchy
as part of a knowledge base.
 An A is a B.
 An A is a C.
 An X is a Y.
 A Z is a C.
 A Y is an A.
 A Z is an X.

a. (5 points) Identify the redundant fact.
 ANSWER: A Z is a C.  (because there is a path from Z to C via X, Y, and A.)

b.    (15 points)

Assume that facts such as these are represented by the edges of a directed
graph.  For example, the fact "An X is a Y" is represented by an edge from
a vertex associated with X to a vertex associated with Y.
Give an algorithm that can find, for any new edge (v1, v2), facts
made redundant, based on transitivity, by the addition of edge (v1, v2).

Use English or pseudocode to describe the algorithm.   You may assume the
existence of a set of VERTICES, a set of EDGES, and a function ISA_TEST(x, y)
that returns True if an x is a y, via any given fact or valid path.

   Input the possibly new fact as the pair (v1, v2).

   If no vertex exists in the graph for v1, then add a new vertex labeled with
     the string associated with v1.
   If no vertex exists in the graph for v2, then add a new vertex labeled with
     the string associated with v2.
   Add the edge (v1, v2) to the graph.

   Let ANCESTORS be the set of all ancestors of v2 in the graph.
   We define an ancestor as any vertex that can be reached from v2 via a path
   in the graph.
   LET DESCENDANTS be the set of descendants of v1 in the graph.
   We define a descendant as any vertex having a path from it to v1.

   For each edge (u, w) in EDGES:
     if U is in DESCENDANTS and w is in ANCESTORS and
       there is a path from u to w that uses the edge (v1, v2):
       THEN the edge (u, w) is made redundant by the addition of (v1, v2)



4. (20 points).

 Consider the wicked problem of providing enough food for the expected world
population in the year 2050.  There are many ways that someone could think about
trying to solve this problem, including such things as developing micro gardens
that people could have in their houses, like fish aquariums, 3D printers that
print food from ingredients like wheat flour and corn syrup, genetic engineering
of protein producers, etc.  Illustrate the state-space search method of structuring
a problem by making up possible (or at least conceivable) entries for each of the
following components:

 a. initial state (5 points). Suggest at least two state variables and explain
the ranges of values that they could take one.

ANSWER:

 (There is no particular "correct" answer, but you should have a data structure
  here, possibly in Python, and some relevant ideas that come across clearly.
  The answer given here is intended to suggest the sort of answer we are looking
  for on this question.)

 INITIAL_STATE = {'global_food_production_per_annum': 7, 
                  'wastage: 1.5',
                  'cost': 1500, 
                  'funds available': 100,
                  'years left': 35}
 # global_food_production_per_annum and wastage are in petacalories.
 # cost and funds available are in billions of dollars, per annum.
 

 b. at least two operators (10 points) including their preconditions and state-transformation
functions.  These could represent actions that a company or that a government might take
to help solve the problem.

 (Operator 1:
    Name: Design and build micro gardens with LED lighting and gen. eng. plant strains.
    Precondition: Funds available are greater than 10 billion per annum.
    State transf: Increase global_food... by 2 %, increase cost by 10 billion,
      reduce funds available by 10 billion; years_left -= 1.)

 (Operator 2:
    Name: Reduce wastage via info. systems and logistics.
    Precondition: wastage > 0.2 and funds available > 1
    State transf: wastage reduced by 30 percent. Funds avail. reduced by 1 billion.
      years_left -= 1.)

 (Operator 3:
    Name: Improve agriculture yields.
    Precondition: funds avail > 5
    State transf: Increase global_food... by 10%, Funds avail. reduced by 2 billiion.
     years_left -= 1.)

 c. a goal criterion (5 points) consisting of a predicate that could be applied to
a state to determine whether or not a path has been found through the state space
that represents a solution plan.

  Goal criterion: global_food... >= 9; wastage at 0.5. funds available > 0, years_left > -1.

 Bayes Rule tells us how to get posterior probabilities from priors, likelihoods and evidence:
 P(H | E) =  P(E | H) P(H) / P(E).

 When the evidence consists of a sequence of features e_0, e_1, ..., e_{n-1},
  the joint probability distribution of these features and H can be an intractibly large table.
  For example, if each e_i has two possible values and H can have two possible values, the
  table would be of size 2^{n+1}.

 a. (10 points).
 As a practical matter, it is common to assume that this joint probability distribution can
 be factored, as if the e_i given H were conditionally independent.  Complete the formula
 that gives this approximation:

 P(E | H ) = P( e_0 and e_1 and ... and e_{n-1} | H ) ~ 

ANSWER: P(e_0 | H) P(e_1 | H)  ... P(e_{n-1} | H)

 b. (10 points). 
 What will happen to a classifier using the model above if the estimate of 
 likelihood P(e_i | H) is set to 0 due to bad luck with sampling the distribution?

ANSWER: The presence of any P(e_i | H) being zero causes the entire estimate of
P(E | H) to be 0, which makes it impossible using Bayes' Rule for P(H | E) to get
a nonzero probability.

 Suggest a way to fix this without doing any more sampling.

ANSWER:
Put a small nonzero value (e.g., 1) into every slot of the table of counts used to
estimate the P(e_i | H) values.  Then normalize all the estimates so that the sums
of probabilities of mutually exclusive events are equal to 1. For example.
If P(light rain | good fishing) seems to be 5 out of 5 and P(not light rain | good fishing)
seems to be 0 out of 5, based on the counts from observations, change those to
5/6 and 1/6.


6. (20 points). Consider the following joint probability distribution.

 e_0 = L = light rain
 e_1 = W = warm temperature
 G = good fishing 

 L  W  G   P(L,M,G)
---------------
 T  T  T   0.2
 T  T  F   0.05
 T  F  T   0.05
 T  F  F   0.1
 F  T  T   0.05
 F  T  F   0.2
 F  F  T   O.05
 F  F  F   O.3

a. (5 points).
Compute the following marginal probabilities:
P(L)   ANSWER: 0.2 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.4
P(W)   ANSWER: 0.2 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.2 = 0.5
P(G)   ANSWER: 0.2 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.35

b. (5 points)
Compute the following likelihoods:
P(L | G)    ANSWER:  (0.2 + 0.05) / 0.35 = 5/7
P(L | ~G)   ANSWER:  (0.05 + 0.1) / 0.65 = 3/13
P(W | G)    ANSWER:  (0.2 + 0.05) / 0.35 = 5/7
P(W | ~G)   ANSWER:  (0.05 + 0.2) / 0.65 = 5/13
P(~L | G)   ANSWER:  1 - P(L | G) = 2/7

c. (5 points)
Use Bayes' Rule to compute P(G | ~L ^ W), which is the probability of
good fishing given the conditions that there's no light rain but the
temperator is warm.

P(G | ~L ^ W) =  P( ~L ^ W | G) P(G) / P( ~L ^ W)
  = (0.05 / 0.35) (0.35) / (0.05 + 0.2)  
  = (0.05) / (0.25) = 1/5

d. (5 points)
Use the Naive Bayes technique to estimate P(G | ~L ^ W).

P(G | ~L ^ W) ~  P(~L | G) P(W | G) P(G) / P( ~L ^ W)
   = (2/7) (5/7) (0.35) / (0.25)
   = 14.0 / 49 = 2/7

7. (20 points)

Consider the following semantic grammar for a robot control interface.


<command> ->  <operation> the <object> 
<command> ->  <command> and then <command>
<command> ->  help on <operation>
<operation> -> store | wash | tidy up | get me
<object> -> dinner plates | table | wine glasses | silverware

Draw a parse tree for the following command:

tidy up the table and then get me the wine glasses

8. (20 points).

Suppose we are going to apply the Hough transform to identify those
light (not dark)
horizontal and vertical lines that have the greatest evidence of
occurrence in a binary image.   The binary image uses pixel value
0 to represent black and pixel value 1 to represent white.

Here is the binary image


1  0  0  1  0

0  0  0  0  0

1  1  0  1  1

0  1  0  1  0

0  1  0  0  0

a. (10 points)
Fill in the values of the array that represents H(theta, rho).

ANSWER:
                         rho
               -2   -1    0    1    2

theta:  0       1    2    4    0    2

        pi/2    2    3    0    3    1

Also acceptable (assuming theta represents the angle between the
  x axis and a perpendicular to the line):
                2    3    0    3    1
                1    2    4    0    2


b. (5 points)
Circle the largest element of this array.
ANSWER:  (4)

c. (5 points)
Draw a line on the binary image that corresponds to this largest element.
ANSWER: (A horizontal line through the middle of the array)

9. (20 points)

a. (15 points)
 State the three laws of robots, according to Isaac Asimov.

ANSWER:
1. A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow
a human being to come to harm.

2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except
where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.


   (5 points)
b. Explain one of the difficulties of achieving the design and deployment of
robots that adhere to these laws.

ANSWER: Determining whether a possible action A might violate the 1st law
could be extremely difficult to judge, since A might have consequences far
in the future that cause harm.  For example, telling a robot to plant
crops at a farm, rather than let a field lay fallow, might cause a shortage
of food in a later year that could contribute to starvation.

10. (20 points).
According to Ray Kurzweil, something remarkable can be expected to happen in the
future, possibly around the year 2041. 

a. (5 points)
What is the name he gives to this predicted phenomenon?

ANSWER: "the singularity"

b. (10 points)
Describe the basic idea of the phenomenon.

ANSWER: Advances in artificial intelligence, computer technology, biology, and
brain science, have been progressing at exponential rates.  As these developments
continue, and as they come to support one another, we can expect a confluence of
scientific and technical progress that permits artificially intelligent systems
to improve themselves more and more rapidly until a seeming explosion of intelligence
occurs in artificial systems.  It is this explosion of power of AI that is the
predicted phenomenon known as the singularity.

c. (5 points)
To what extent do you agree with this prediction, and why?

ANSWER:  I believe that the current trends of increasingly rapid progress in
AI and biology are likely to continue, and that they will increasingly have
interactions:  AI systems will help us learn more about biological systems and
about the human brain.  That knowledge will help us to improve AI systems.
Robots and automatic programming systems will facilitate the creation of more
powerful AI systems and better robots.   Whether we consider the resulting
improvements in technology to be an explosion or a singularity will depend
on the time frame from which we judge the phenomenon.   From the time scale
of human history, this improvement will definitely look like a singularity
on a graph of technical knowledge vs time.   However, zooming way in on the
curve, it might still look continuous and finite.  It might be superexponential
growth, but even a superexponential function can be continuous and everywhere
differentiable, theoretically speaking.

(NOTE: This is an example answer that would be acceptable.  Various other
answers would also be fine.)
